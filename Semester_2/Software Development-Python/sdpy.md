# Software Development Course

This course has been designed to give an overview of basic python programming skills along with the brief introduction to the git and version controlling. 
This course also introduces high-level ways to develop conda env using Anaconda Navigator and Jupyter suite. 
The following section highlights some of the assignments that have been completed as part of the course that will exemplify the learnings from this course. 

# Assignments

## Assignment 1: GitHub Basics
- **Objective:** Understand fundamental GitHub operations.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Create a GitHub repository.
  2. Commit changes to the repository.
  3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  4. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

## Assignment 2: Conda Environment and Jupyter
- **Objective:** Learn about conda environments and use Jupyter notebooks.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Set up a conda environment.
  2. Use both Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab within the environment.

## Assignment 3: Geo-specific Python Libraries
- **Objective:** Work with geo-specific Python libraries in a notebook.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Perform operations with GDAL, rasterio, folium, or another geo-specific library.
  2. Document the process and results in a Jupyter notebook.

## Assignment 4: Python Script with Geo-specific Functions
- **Objective:** Create and document a Python script with geo-specific functions.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Write a script with a docstring at the top.
  2. Include at least three geo-specific functions, importing necessary libraries.
  3. Add docstrings for each function and comments where needed.
  4. Create a Jupyter notebook:
     - Import the script.
     - Explain and demonstrate the usage of each function with markdown cells.

## Final Project
- **Objective:** Showcase the culmination of all assignments and make a group project
- **Tasks:**
  1. Provide a GitHub link to your final project.
  2. Ensure the repository includes the notebook and the necessary conda environment file.
